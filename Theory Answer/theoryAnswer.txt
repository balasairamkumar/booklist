State Management :

State Management can be achieved using Session or cookies..

In session , an object has to be created for HttpSession type..
For that HttpSession object we can set name-value pair using setAttribute method of the object
Later on in the other pages we can retrieve the HttpSession object with getSession(false)..

here the parameter false that is sent to getSession ensures that if no session is active, no new session will
be created..

The second method to maintain session is by cookies..

the user will create a new cookie and add a name value pair for that cookie..

like Cookies myCookie = new Cookie("name","username");

later this particular cookie can be sent to the next page by response.addCookie(myCookie);

even if the user not enabled cookies the API container itself will create a JSESSIONID which can be 
passed with URL by the method encodeURL("urlName")
